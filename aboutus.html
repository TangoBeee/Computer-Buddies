					<h3>What is Computer-Buddies</h3>
					<p>The Computer-Buddies (CB) is a discord community geared towards programming. The use of the word "geared" here is important because more accurately it's a discord for programmers of all kinds. If you're a green noob with 5 lines of code under your belt, or if you're a veteran with 15 years of industry experience, CB has a place for you. More than that, there are over 90,000 people here. You can guarantee you won't be the only person with your experience level on the server</p>
